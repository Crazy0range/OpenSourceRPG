This aim of this project has changed so many times that it is stuck in some sort
of halfway house. The code has beem transferred to the latest version of
Troy's Code, and has been cleaned up considerably HOWEVER it is still a bit messy
and due to it's changed aims there are a few features without purpose and there
is some left over code from partially removed features.

That makes it sound much worse than it really is, and when I have time again I will
return to clean it up further.

I hope this source code is useful, even if the game itself isn't!
